Creating an "EcoRoute-Planner" is a comprehensive task, as it involves integrating real-time traffic data, environmental data, and using algorithms to compute the most eco-friendly paths. Below is a simplified version of such a program in Python. This version focuses on structure, data handling, and basic error management. It assumes the availability of relevant APIs and libraries for map routing and data fetching.

First, ensure you have access to necessary services or APIs, such as routing services (e.g., Google Maps API), traffic data, and environmental data APIs. You can use libraries like `requests` for API calls and `networkx` for graph-based routing solutions.

Here's a structure for the program:

```python
import requests
import networkx as nx
import json
from geopy.distance import great_circle

# Constants
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = 'YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY'
TRAFFIC_API_KEY = 'YOUR_TRAFFIC_API_KEY'
ENVIRONMENT_API_KEY = 'YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_API_KEY'

# Example City Coordinates
START_COORDINATES = (40.712776, -74.005974)  # New York City
END_COORDINATES = (34.052235, -118.243683)   # Los Angeles

def fetch_route_data(start, end):
    try:
        # Here, you would typically incorporate a real API call to a service like Google Maps
        url = f"https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/json?origin={start[0]},{start[1]}&destination={end[0]},{end[1]}&key={GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()

        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Other error occurred: {err}")
    return None

def fetch_traffic_data(route):
    try:
        # Call your traffic data API here
        # This is a placeholder for how the request might look like
        url = f"https://api.traffic.com/get?route={route}&key={TRAFFIC_API_KEY}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()

        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Other error occurred: {err}")
    return None

def fetch_environment_data(route):
    try:
        # Call your environment data API here
        url = f"https://api.environment.com/get?route={route}&key={ENVIRONMENT_API_KEY}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()

        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.HTTPError as http_err:
        print(f"HTTP error occurred: {http_err}")
    except Exception as err:
        print(f"Other error occurred: {err}")
    return None

def compute_eco_friendly_route(route_data, traffic_data, environment_data):
    # This function will create a graph and compute the best eco-friendly path
    G = nx.DiGraph()

    # Example processing logic: for each section of the route, add it to the graph
    for section in route_data['routes'][0]['legs'][0]['steps']:
        start_location = (section['start_location']['lat'], section['start_location']['lng'])
        end_location = (section['end_location']['lat'], section['end_location']['lng'])
        distance = great_circle(start_location, end_location).km

        # Fetch traffic and environment weights dynamically
        traffic_factor = traffic_data.get('traffic_factor', 1)
        env_factor = environment_data.get('env_factor', 1)

        weight = distance * traffic_factor * env_factor

        G.add_edge(start_location, end_location, weight=weight)

    return nx.shortest_path(G, source=START_COORDINATES, target=END_COORDINATES, weight='weight')

def main():
    route_data = fetch_route_data(START_COORDINATES, END_COORDINATES)
    if not route_data:
        print("Failed to fetch route data.")
        return

    # Example route representation
    example_route = "New York City to Los Angeles"
    traffic_data = fetch_traffic_data(example_route)
    if not traffic_data:
        print("Failed to fetch traffic data.")
        return

    environment_data = fetch_environment_data(example_route)
    if not environment_data:
        print("Failed to fetch environment data.")
        return

    eco_route = compute_eco_friendly_route(route_data, traffic_data, environment_data)
    
    if eco_route:
        print("Eco-Friendly Route:")
        for step in eco_route:
            print(step)
    else:
        print("Failed to compute eco-friendly route.")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

### Important Points:

1. **API Integration**: In a real-world application, you'd need to integrate it with live APIs for traffic, routing, and environmental data. You would need to replace the placeholders with actual API calls and process their responses accordingly.

2. **Weight Calculation**: The computation of the eco-friendly route is simplified. Typically, you'd have more sophisticated metrics that consider carbon emissions factors, congestion levels, and environmental impacts.

3. **Network Graph**: NetworkX is used here for computation. This library suits well for routing problems.

4. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is provided using try-except blocks. A more robust solution might involve specific exception cases or retry logic.

5. **Environment and Traffic APIs**: These are critical for an eco-routing application, needing accurate and real-time data. You might need to explore service providers for these data points.

This guide serves as a foundational framework and will need expansion and refinement with actual data sources and algorithms for a working product.
